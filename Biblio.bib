abstract = {Auxetic materials (or metamaterials) are those with a negative Poisson ratio (NPR) and display the unexpected property of lateral expansion when stretched, as well as an equal and opposing densification when compressed. Such geometries are being progressively employed in the development of novel products, especially in the fields of intelligent expandable actuators, shape morphing structures and minimally invasive implantable devices. Although several auxetic and potentially auxetic geometries have been summarized in previous reviews and research, precise information regarding relevant properties for design tasks is not always provided. In this study we present a comparative study of two-dimensional and three-dimensional auxetic geometries carried out by means of computer-aided design and engineering tools (from now on CADCAE). The first part of the study is focused on the development of a CAD library of auxetics. Once the library is developed we simulate the behavior of the different auxetic geometries and elaborate a systematic comparison, considering relevant properties of these geometries, such as Poisson ratio(s), maximum volume or area reductions attainable and equivalent Youngs modulus, hoping it may provide useful information for future designs of devices based on these interesting structures. {\textcopyright} 2012 IOP Publishing Ltd.},

abstract = {Auxetic cellular tubes are emerging as potential candidates for a number of critical devices requiring high resistance to kinking, such as angioplasty stents or annuloplasty rings. This work investigates the collapse under pure bending of auxetic tubes based on inverted hexagonal honeycombs, with the aim to identify design strategies suitable for improving their kinking response. First, the mechanical properties of the structure are determined under small deformation by means of analytical approaches, and used to verify the validity of numerical models. These are then used to simulate the tube collapse under pure bending, and identify the influence of the geometric parameters defining the structure on the phenomenon. The study indicates that the adoption of auxetic tubular structures can contribute to improving considerably the resistance to kinking, suggesting the parameters to be controlled in the design of critical applications. {\textcopyright} 2013 IOP Publishing Ltd.},

In this paper, we focus on needle manipulation for interventional radiology. We propose a needle driver, i.e. a linear actuator for needle insertion, based on the inchworm principle combined with pneumatic energy. Our first contribution is to propose, model and implement the device using a so-called auxetic structure. Its use increases achievable displacement under pressure and provides sufficient off-axis stiffness to use the actuator without additional guidance. Simplified modeling is introduced for the actuator synthesis. Our second contribution is to implement the actuator with multimaterial additive manufacturing combining rigid and flexible materials to increase compactness. As a third contribution, initial assessment of component sterilization and compatibility with X-ray and MRI imaging modalities is presented.},

There are several challenges that AM processes must face in order to achieve reliable industrial-level applications. Thereby, improving dimensional and geometrical quality of AM parts has turned to be a key issue. Research efforts should be conducted in order to improve part quality, with the purpose of achieving industrial-degree tolerances. This objective becomes more relevant when parts have been designed to provide fitting, like those involving Features of Size (FoS). Present work deals with the analysis of factors influencing the quality of cylindrical features, on parts that have been manufactured using the PolyJet process.

abstract = {Purpose - This paper aims to seek to fill a gap in the literature by characterizing the fatigue life and microstructure of a printed elastomer material, the TangoBlackPlus material. Design/methodology/approach - Because the TangoBlackPlus material is marketed as "rubber-like", the printed elastomer specimens were tested according to the ASTM D4482-11 "Test Method for Rubber Property Extension Cycling Fatigue". The microstructure of the printed material and multi-material interface was examined by slicing specimens and examining them under an optical microscope. Findings - Findings are developed to show the relationship between elongation and expected fatigue life. Findings also indicate that the smoother, non-support encased "glossy" surface finish option for PolyJet parts improve the fatigue life of components and that there are a number of microscopic voids in the TangoBlackPlus material that seem to be concentrated at layer and print head boundaries. Research limitations/implications - This paper provides a glimpse into the fatigue properties and microstructure of printed elastomeric parts, a previously unstudied area. This work is limited in that it only looks at specimens created in a single orientation, on a single machine, with a single material. More work is needed to understand the general fatigue properties of printed elastomers and the factors that influence fatigue life in these materials. Practical implications - The authors provide several design guidelines based on the findings and previous work that can be used to increase the fatigue life of printed elastomer components. Originality/value - As additive manufacturing (AM) technology moves from a prototyping tool to a tool used to create end use products, it is important to examine the expected lifespan of AM components. This work adds to the understanding of the expected product lifecycle of printed elastomer components that will likely be expected to withstand large repeated loading conditions.},

As is the case with other 3D printing methods, parts fabricated from ME3DP will exhibit physical property anisotropy where build direction has an effect on the mechanical properties of a given part. The work presented in this paper analyzes the effect of physical property-altering additives to acrylonitrile butadiene styrene (ABS) on mechanical property anisotropy. A total of six ABS-based polymer matrix composites and four polymer blends were created and evaluated. Tensile test specimens were printed in two build orientations and the differences in ultimate tensile strength and {\%} elongation at break were compared between the two test sample versions. Fracture surface analysis was performed via scanning electron microscopy (SEM) which gave insight to the failure modes and rheology of the novel material systems as compared to specimens fabricated from the same ABS base resin. Here it was found that a ternary blend of ABS combined with styrene ethylene butadiene styrene (SEBS) and ultra high molecular weight polyethylene (UHMWPE) lowered the mechanical property anisotropy in terms of relative UTS to a difference of 22. ±. 2.07{\%} as compared to 47. ±. 7.23{\%} for samples printed from ABS. The work here demonstrates the mitigation of a problem associated with 3D printing as a whole through novel materials development and analyzes the effects of adding a wide variety of materials on the physical properties of a thermoplastic base resin.},

abstract = {The current study reports the mechanical properties of 3D printing using multiple composite filaments, infill percentages, and printed structures. Results show that graphene-contained polylactic acid (G-PLA) displays the highest bending strength, of 119.50 MPa, improving by 62.7{\%}, compared with pure PLA. The scanning electron microscopy (SEM) microstructural observations indicate that the high bending strength is caused by the pull-out of graphene. As for the double-filament layer-by-layer alternatively printed specimens, the obtained bending strengths are between the single-filament specimens printed by the two filaments, respectively. Changing infill percentages from 30{\%}, 65{\%}, and to 100{\%} prove that the mechanical properties are greatly enhanced. In the bending tests, with an increase in the infill percentage from 30{\%} to 100{\%}, it is found that all the bending strengths of G-PLA, copper powder-containing polylactic acid (Cu-PLA), and carbon fibers-containing Cf-PLA increase by 63.7{\%}, 130.1{\%}, and 106.6{\%} on account of enlarged cross-section areas sustaining stress. Furthermore, in the compressive tests, shear stress is only found in the hexangular structure, which has a positive effect on the 32.1{\%} increase of the compressive strength compared with that in the rectangular structure. It implies that printed structures significantly influence the fractured modes due to the variation of stress distribution in the designed structures.},

abstract = {Predicting the binding mode of flexible polypeptides to proteins is an important task that falls outside the domain of applicability of most small molecule and protein−protein docking tools. Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-$\alpha$-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 {\AA} for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21{\%} with default Glide SP settings to 58{\%} with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63{\%} success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40{\%} of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

abstract = {In Additive Manufacturing (AM), parts are manufactured layer-upon-layer. This strategy affects the mechanical properties of AM parts, since they cannot just be assimilated to those of parts manufactured by traditional methods. The PolyJet AM technology uses UV energy to cure layers of photopolymer that are stacked one on top of the following. The amount of energy that reaches each layer is related to several aspects of the manufacturing procedure, such as jetting head displacement strategy or UV irradiation pattern. This work aims to analyse the relative influence of configuration parameters on the relaxation modulus E(t) of flat parts manufactured using PolyJet technology and orientated on the XY plane. Evolution of material properties with respect to time has been used since parts shall present viscoelastic behaviour. Four factors have been evaluated: part spacing along X axis ($\Delta$x) and along the Y axis ($\Delta$y), orientation of the part within the tray ($\phi$) and surface quality (Q). Influence of Q has been included since material properties could be modified by UV shielding effect. Experimental results have pointed out that Y-spacing and orientation $\phi$ both affect E(t).},

abstract = {Study of the plastic deformation in polymeric honeycombs can pave the way for understanding the deformation localization in more complex cellular structures, which have received progressive attention in the past few years. This study compares the strain localization in deforming honeycombs made by two cost-effective 3D-printing technologies. Hexagonal honeycombs and their unit cell models were 3D-printed by both PolyJet™, using a photo-crosslinkable polymer, and fused deposition modeling (FDM) using a thermoplastic material. The state of the art digital image correlation (DIC) technique was employed as the experimental route in order to calculate the strain field during the deformation of manufactured parts. It was found that DIC is an effective tool to study the localization in 3D-printed honeycomb struts. Moreover, in comparison with FDM, PolyJet technology provides more homogeneous strain distributions in struts. In addition, FDM decreases the maximal strains generated on the side layers of the honeycomb struts. Accordingly, the ligament damage under plastic deformation can be postponed and the energy absorption capability of the product can be improved when PolyJet technology is utilized.},

Ochratoxins and Aflatoxins are mycotoxins of major significance and hence there has been significant research on broad range of analytical and detection techniques that could be useful and practical. Due to the variety of structures of these toxins, it is impossible to use one standard technique for analysis and/or detection. Practical requirements for high-sensitivity analysis and the need for a specialist laboratory setting create challenges for routine analysis. Several existing analytical techniques, which offer flexible and broad-based methods of analysis and in some cases detection, have been discussed in this manuscript. There are a number of methods used, of which many are lab-based, but to our knowledge there seems to be no single technique that stands out above the rest, although analytical liquid chromatography, commonly linked with mass spectroscopy is likely to be popular. This review manuscript discusses (a) sample pre-treatment methods such as liquid-liquid extraction (LLE), supercritical fluid extraction (SFE), solid phase extraction (SPE), (b) separation methods such as (TLC), high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), gas chromatography (GC), and capillary electrophoresis (CE) and (c) others such as ELISA.

abstract = {Most devices for single-site or natural orifice transluminal surgery are very application specific and, hence, capable of effectively carrying out specific surgical tasks only. However, most of these instruments are rigid, lack a sufficient number of degrees of freedom (DOFs), and/or are incapable of modifying their mechanical properties based on the tasks to be performed. The current philosophy in commercial instrument design is mainly focused on creating minimally invasive surgical systems using rigid tools equipped with dexterous tips. Only few research efforts are aimed at developing flexible surgical systems, with many DOFs or even continuum kinematics. The authors propose a radical change in surgical instrument design: away from rigid tools toward a new concept of soft and stiffness-controllable instruments. Inspired by biology, we envision creating such soft and stiffness-controllable medical devices using the octopus as a model. The octopus presents all the capabilities requested and can be viewed as a precious source of inspiration. Several soft technologies are suitable for meeting the aforementioned capabilities, and in this article a brief review of the most promising ones is presented. Then we illustrate how specific technologies can be applied in the design of a novel manipulator for flexible surgery by discussing its potential and by presenting feasibility tests of a prototype responding to this new design philosophy. Our aim is to investigate the feasibility of applying these technologies in the field of minimally invasive surgery and at the same time to stimulate the creativeness of others who could take the proposed concepts further to achieve novel solutions and generate specific application scenarios for the devised technologies.},

A simple, reproducible way of designing and fabricating RAE actuators is described and varied prototypes are shown.

abstract = {This article details steps in creating low-power artificial muscles using 3D printing. It describes a manufacturing system that can be used to fabricate seamless tubular dielectric elastomer actuators (DEA), for eventual use in biorobotic devices. The focus is on producing passive elastomeric components of DEA and the dimensional changes that occur after printing is complete. A four-axis printing system is described, capable of spray depositing multilayer tubular silicone membranes onto an air-permeable mandrel. Mechanical strain was imparted in the membranes by means of inflation. A laser measurement system was constructed to act as a 3D scanner, which measured the shape of the inflated "balloon." The surface shape was reconstructed in software using the parametric modeling tool Grasshopper. Seamless auxetic tessellations were calculated across the entire surface, and then converted to CNC GCode. These toolpaths were then physically extruded over the surface of the balloon, stacked five layers high. When the extruded silicone structure was completely cured, the pneumatic strain was released, allowing the structure to collapse evenly. The compression in the printed structure was balanced by the tension in the stretched membranes, thus producing a minimum energy structure.},

abstract = {One major obstacle to the development of a piezoelectrically-driven actuator with a large motion range is the requirement to provide a high load capacity and a reliable self-locking capability simultaneously for most applications. In this work, a piezo-driven rotary actuator with a simple and compact structure is designed based on the inchworm principle to realize long-range rotary motion. High driving torque with a self-locking capability at rest is achieved by integral design of the overall structure, in which the distributions and stiffness values of the flexure hinges are carefully designed. A prototype was fabricated and the working performance of the device was tested. The test results demonstrate that the driving torque of the prototype is more than 245 Nmm, with self-locking torque of more than 882 Nmm. In addition, the maximum rotary speed is 26.74 mrad/s at a driving frequency of 180 Hz, and a minimum step rotary angle of 4.79 $\mu$rad is obtained at a step driving voltage of 10 V.},

The clamping device is innovated using multistack piezoelectric actuators with displacement amplifier since the displacement generated from multistack actuator is not enough for clamping. To secure the large push load and displacement, Terfenol-D magnetostrictive material is used for the push device. Design process of the push and clamping devices is conducted to meet the performance of the motor. The clamping and push devices are assembled and a control sequence is applied. The performance of the inchworm motor is tested in terms of speed and force. The moving speed is increasing when the input frequency and current are increased. To make the performance stable, time tuning between the push and clamping devices signals is necessary.

abstract = {This paper presents a proof-of-concept design of an inchworm-type piezoelectric actuator of large displacement and force (or power) for shape control and vibration control of adaptive truss structures. Applications for such actuators include smart or adaptive structural systems, auto and aerospace industries. The proposed inchworm-type actuator consists of three main components with frictional clamping mechanisms: two clamping or braking devices and one expanding device. The two frictional clamping devices provide alternating braking forces when the moving shaft, which is pushed by expanding device, walks inside the PZT tubular stack and emulates an inchworm, summing small steps to achieve large displacements. Since the development of a robust clamping mechanism is essential to realize the high force capability, a considerable design effort has been focused on optimizing the clamping device to increase the output force. CATIA is used as a platform to model the whole actuator and ANSYS is used to analyze and optimize the performance of the actuator. The proposed design avoids the tight tolerance of the tube diameters and reduces the clearance between clamps and the moving shaft with the adjustment device. The moving shaft of the actuator could also be replaced by one member of a truss structure for vibration suppression and position control purposes. In the proposed actuator the flexure clamps can also be easily replaced to outfit different dynamic characteristics. The complete design of the proposed actuator has been performed using the finite element analysis. The simulation result confirms that the output force of 160 N and incremental displacement in each step of 8.3 $\mu$m can be achieved using the proposed actuator. A prototype of actuator has been fabricated and static tests have been performed to validate the simulation results. {\textcopyright} 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Linear Incremental Hydraulic Actuators combine one or more short-stroke cylinders, and two or more engaging/disengaging mechanisms into one actuator with long, medium, or even unlimited stroke length. The motion of each single short-stroke actuator concatenated by the engaging/disengaging mechanisms forms the motion of the linear incremental hydraulic actuator. The patterns of how these motions are concatenated form the gaits of a specific linear incremental hydraulic actuator. Linear incremental hydraulic actuators may have more than one gait. In an application, the gaits may be combined to achieve optimal performance at various operating points. The distinguishing characteristic of linear incremental hydraulic actuators is the incremental motion. The term incremental actuator is seen as analogous to the incremental versus absolute position sensor. Incremental actuators realize naturally relative positioning. Incremental motion means also that the behavior does not depend on an absolute position but only on the relative position within a cycle or step. Incremental actuators may realize discrete incremental or continuous incremental motion. Discrete incremental actuators can only approach discrete positions, whereby stepper drives are one prominent example. In contrast, continuous incremental actuators may approach any position. Linear electric motors are one example of continuous incremental actuators. The actuator has no inherent limitation in stroke length, as every step or cycle adds only to the state at the beginning of the step or cycle and does not depend on the absolute position. This led to the alternative working title Hydraulic Infinite Linear Actuator. Linear incremental hydraulic actuator provides long stroke, high force, and linear motion and has the potential to decrease the necessary resource usage, minimize environmental impact, e.g. from potential oil spillage, extend the range of feasible products: longer, stiffer, better, etc. This thesis presents an analysis of the characteristics and properties of linear incremental hydraulic actuators as well as the gaits and possible realizations of some gaits. The gait for continuous, smooth motion with two cylinders is comprehensively studied and a control concept for the tracking problem is proposed. The control concept encapsulates the complexity of the linear incremental hydraulic actuator so that an application does not have to deal with it. One other gait, the ballistic gait, which realizes fast, energy-efficient motion, enabling energy recuperation is studied. },

One route to simplification is to design the robot's body using 'smart materials' that carry the burden of control and actuation. Metamaterials enable just such rational design of the material properties. Here we present a soft robot that exploits mechanical metamaterials for the intrinsic synchronization of two passive clutches which contact its travel surface. Doing so allows it to move through an enclosed passage with an inchworm motion propelled by a single actuator. Our soft robot consists of two 3D-printed metamaterials that implement auxetic and normal elastic properties. The design, fabrication and characterization of the metamaterials are described. In addition, a working soft robot is presented. Since the synchronization mechanism is a feature of the robot's material body, we believe that the proposed design will enable compliant and robust implementations that scale well with miniaturization.},

Several structural models are examined. The non-affine kinematics are seen to be essential for the production of negative Poisson's ratios for isotropic materials containing central force linkages of positive stiffness. Non-central forces combined with pre-load can also give rise to a negative Poisson's ratio in isotropic materials. A chiral microstructure with noncentral force interaction or non-affine deformation can also exhibit a negative Poisson's ratio. Toughness and damage resistance in these materials may be affected by the Poisson's ratio itself, as well as by generalized continuum aspects associated with the microstructure. {\textcopyright} 1991 Chapman and Hall Ltd.},

We apply our method to different families of structures based on isohedral tilings - a simple yet extensive and aesthetically interesting group of space-filling patterns. We show that these tilings admit a wide range of material properties, and our homogenization approach allows us to create concise and intuitive descriptions of a material's direction-dependent macromechanical behavior that are easy to communicate even to non-experts.

By enabling multiple actuating elements, integrated in a compact and lightweight single unit controlled by ordinary directional valves it is possible to achieve a high position accuracy. This is a new way to generate and distribute mechanical linear movement and force by using hydraulic actuators in a cost effective way, in less responsive closed loop systems. This is a variant on the Hydraulic Infinite Linear Actuator, HILA, invention. The technology also represents a new sort of digital hydraulics. The presented technology provides typical hydraulic actuator characteristics with high system pressure and potentially no external oil leakage. It is based on a well-known hydraulic clamping element technology used in a new way, where the piston and the piston rod can quickly be coupled and uncoupled by means of the clamping element in a failsafe way by using well defined incremental steps. HILA in its simplest usage, provides new features to hydraulic cylinders such as providing very long strokes, high rod speed, and small chamber volumes which means high stiffness and low capacitance. The aim of this study is to present a fundamentally new way of using hydraulic actuators. The invention is called the Hydraulic Infinite Linear Actuator with Multiple Rods, HILA MR. The study presents the idea, principles and feasible combinations of the technology. Also applications in the aircraft and robotic field will be presented. },

abstract = {Compliant structures allow robots to overcome environmental challenges by deforming and conforming their bodies. In this paper, we investigate auxetic structures as a means of achieving this compliance for soft robots. Taking a tiling based approach, we fabricate 3D printed cylindrical auxetic structures to create tiled auxetic cylinders (TACs). We characterise the relative stiffness of the structures and show that variation in behaviour can be achieved by modifying the geometry within the same tiling family. In addition, we analysed the equivalent Poisson's ratio and found the range between the investigated designs to span from -0.33 to -2. Furthermore, we demonstrate a conceptual application in the design of a soft robot using the auxetic cylinders. We show that these structures can reactively change in shape, thereby reducing the complexity of control, with potential applications in confined spaces such as the human body, or for exploration through unpredictable terrain.},

abstract = {This work describes the centrifugal casting and fast curing of double-sided, polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS)-based components with microfeatures. Centrifugal casting permits simultaneous patterning of multiple sides of a component and allows control of the thickness of the part in an enclosed mold without entrapment of bubbles. Spinning molds filled with PDMS at thousands of revolutions per minute for several minutes causes entrapped bubbles within the PDMS to migrate toward the axis of rotation or dissolve into solution. To cure the parts quickly ({\textless}10 min), active elements heat and cool cavities filled with PDMS after the completion of spinning. Microfluidic channels produced from the process have a low coefficient of variation ({\textless}2{\%} for the height and width of channels measured in 20 parts). This process is also capable of molding functional channels in opposite sides of a part as demonstrated through a device with a system of valves typical to multilayer soft lithography.},

This is in particular true when physical interaction between a robot and its environment is involved.

In this development, soft robotics has remained very closely dependent on advanced manufacturing processes, a topic which deserves special attention.

That is, three viable actuator morphologies composed entirely from soft silicone rubber are explored, and these morphologies are differentiated by their internal channel structure, namely, ribbed, cylindrical, and pleated. Additionally, three distinct casting-based fabrication processes are explored: lamination-based casting, retractable-pin-based casting, and lost-wax-based casting. Furthermore, two ways of fabricating a multiple DOF robot are explored: casting the complete robot as a whole and casting single degree of freedom (DOF) segments with subsequent concatenation. We experimentally validate each soft actuator morphology and fabrication process by creating multiple physical soft robot prototypes.},
