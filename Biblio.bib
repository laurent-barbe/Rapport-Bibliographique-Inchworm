abstract = {Static models of braided pneumatic muscles (BPMs) reported in the research literature fairly accurately predict the muscle-force-carrying capacity. These models, however, rely on experimentally determined parameters that are valid only for the specific muscle configuration under consideration. This paper presents a fully analytical BPM static model that does not depend on experimentally determined parameters. The proposed approach is based on Newtonian mechanics that considers the mechanical and the geometrical properties of the muscle. Distinctively, this paper includes the muscle end-fixture-diameter effect. Results from the developed model are compared with the experimental ones that have been obtained from prototype BPMs. {\textcopyright} 2009 IEEE.},

abstract = {This paper presents the concept design of a modular soft manipulator for minimally invasive surgery. Unlike traditional surgical manipulators based on metallic steerable needles, tendon-driven mechanisms, or articulated motorized links, we combine flexible fluidic actuators to obtain multidirectional bending and elongation with a variable stiffness mechanism based on granular jamming. The idea is to develop a manipulator based on a series of modules, each consisting of a silicone matrix with pneumatic chambers for 3-D motion, and one central channel for the integration of granular-jamming-based stiffening mechanism. A bellows-shaped braided structure is used to contain the lateral expansion of the flexible fluidic actuator and to increase its motion range. In this paper, the design and experimental characterization of a single module composed of such a manipulator is presented. Possible applications of the manipulator in the surgical field are discussed.},

Analytical models for predicting the response behavior have used both virtual work methods and continuum mechanics. Various nonlinear control algorithms have been developed, including sliding mode control (SMC), adaptive control, neural networks, etc. In addition to traditional fluid-driving methods, innovative techniques such as chemical and electrical driving techniques are reviewed.

abstract = {Mycotoxins are small (MW approximately 700), toxic chemical products formed as secondary metabolites by a few fungal species that readily colonise crops and contaminate them with toxins in the field or after harvest. Ochratoxins and Aflatoxins are mycotoxins of major significance and hence there has been significant research on broad range of analytical and detection techniques that could be useful and practical. Due to the variety of structures of these toxins, it is impossible to use one standard technique for analysis and/or detection. Practical requirements for high-sensitivity analysis and the need for a specialist laboratory setting create challenges for routine analysis. Several existing analytical techniques, which offer flexible and broad-based methods of analysis and in some cases detection, have been discussed in this manuscript. There are a number of methods used, of which many are lab-based, but to our knowledge there seems to be no single technique that stands out above the rest, although analytical liquid chromatography, commonly linked with mass spectroscopy is likely to be popular. This review manuscript discusses (a) sample pre-treatment methods such as liquid-liquid extraction (LLE), supercritical fluid extraction (SFE), solid phase extraction (SPE), (b) separation methods such as (TLC), high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), gas chromatography (GC), and capillary electrophoresis (CE) and (c) others such as ELISA. Further currents trends, advantages and disadvantages and future prospects of these methods have been discussed.},

abstract = {Purpose - This paper aims to seek to fill a gap in the literature by characterizing the fatigue life and microstructure of a printed elastomer material, the TangoBlackPlus material. Design/methodology/approach - Because the TangoBlackPlus material is marketed as "rubber-like", the printed elastomer specimens were tested according to the ASTM D4482-11 "Test Method for Rubber Property Extension Cycling Fatigue". The microstructure of the printed material and multi-material interface was examined by slicing specimens and examining them under an optical microscope. Findings - Findings are developed to show the relationship between elongation and expected fatigue life. Findings also indicate that the smoother, non-support encased "glossy" surface finish option for PolyJet parts improve the fatigue life of components and that there are a number of microscopic voids in the TangoBlackPlus material that seem to be concentrated at layer and print head boundaries. Research limitations/implications - This paper provides a glimpse into the fatigue properties and microstructure of printed elastomeric parts, a previously unstudied area. This work is limited in that it only looks at specimens created in a single orientation, on a single machine, with a single material. More work is needed to understand the general fatigue properties of printed elastomers and the factors that influence fatigue life in these materials. Practical implications - The authors provide several design guidelines based on the findings and previous work that can be used to increase the fatigue life of printed elastomer components. Originality/value - As additive manufacturing (AM) technology moves from a prototyping tool to a tool used to create end use products, it is important to examine the expected lifespan of AM components. This work adds to the understanding of the expected product lifecycle of printed elastomer components that will likely be expected to withstand large repeated loading conditions.},

One route to simplification is to design the robot's body using 'smart materials' that carry the burden of control and actuation. Metamaterials enable just such rational design of the material properties. Here we present a soft robot that exploits mechanical metamaterials for the intrinsic synchronization of two passive clutches which contact its travel surface. Doing so allows it to move through an enclosed passage with an inchworm motion propelled by a single actuator. Our soft robot consists of two 3D-printed metamaterials that implement auxetic and normal elastic properties. The design, fabrication and characterization of the metamaterials are described. In addition, a working soft robot is presented. Since the synchronization mechanism is a feature of the robot's material body, we believe that the proposed design will enable compliant and robust implementations that scale well with miniaturization.},

abstract = {In Additive Manufacturing (AM), parts are manufactured layer-upon-layer. This strategy affects the mechanical properties of AM parts, since they cannot just be assimilated to those of parts manufactured by traditional methods. The PolyJet AM technology uses UV energy to cure layers of photopolymer that are stacked one on top of the following. The amount of energy that reaches each layer is related to several aspects of the manufacturing procedure, such as jetting head displacement strategy or UV irradiation pattern. This work aims to analyse the relative influence of configuration parameters on the relaxation modulus E(t) of flat parts manufactured using PolyJet technology and orientated on the XY plane. Evolution of material properties with respect to time has been used since parts shall present viscoelastic behaviour. Four factors have been evaluated: part spacing along X axis ($\Delta$x) and along the Y axis ($\Delta$y), orientation of the part within the tray ($\phi$) and surface quality (Q). Influence of Q has been included since material properties could be modified by UV shielding effect. Experimental results have pointed out that Y-spacing and orientation $\phi$ both affect E(t).},

High driving torque with a self-locking capability at rest is achieved by integral design of the overall structure, in which the distributions and stiffness values of the flexure hinges are carefully designed. A prototype was fabricated and the working performance of the device was tested. The test results demonstrate that the driving torque of the prototype is more than 245 Nmm, with self-locking torque of more than 882 Nmm. In addition, the maximum rotary speed is 26.74 mrad/s at a driving frequency of 180 Hz, and a minimum step rotary angle of 4.79 $\mu$rad is obtained at a step driving voltage of 10 V.},

As is the case with other 3D printing methods, parts fabricated from ME3DP will exhibit physical property anisotropy where build direction has an effect on the mechanical properties of a given part. The work presented in this paper analyzes the effect of physical property-altering additives to acrylonitrile butadiene styrene (ABS) on mechanical property anisotropy. A total of six ABS-based polymer matrix composites and four polymer blends were created and evaluated. Tensile test specimens were printed in two build orientations and the differences in ultimate tensile strength and {\%} elongation at break were compared between the two test sample versions. Fracture surface analysis was performed via scanning electron microscopy (SEM) which gave insight to the failure modes and rheology of the novel material systems as compared to specimens fabricated from the same ABS base resin. Here it was found that a ternary blend of ABS combined with styrene ethylene butadiene styrene (SEBS) and ultra high molecular weight polyethylene (UHMWPE) lowered the mechanical property anisotropy in terms of relative UTS to a difference of 22. ±. 2.07{\%} as compared to 47. ±. 7.23{\%} for samples printed from ABS. The work here demonstrates the mitigation of a problem associated with 3D printing as a whole through novel materials development and analyzes the effects of adding a wide variety of materials on the physical properties of a thermoplastic base resin.},

abstract = {This paper presents a proof-of-concept design of an inchworm-type piezoelectric actuator of large displacement and force (or power) for shape control and vibration control of adaptive truss structures. Applications for such actuators include smart or adaptive structural systems, auto and aerospace industries. The proposed inchworm-type actuator consists of three main components with frictional clamping mechanisms: two clamping or braking devices and one expanding device. The two frictional clamping devices provide alternating braking forces when the moving shaft, which is pushed by expanding device, walks inside the PZT tubular stack and emulates an inchworm, summing small steps to achieve large displacements. Since the development of a robust clamping mechanism is essential to realize the high force capability, a considerable design effort has been focused on optimizing the clamping device to increase the output force. CATIA is used as a platform to model the whole actuator and ANSYS is used to analyze and optimize the performance of the actuator. The proposed design avoids the tight tolerance of the tube diameters and reduces the clearance between clamps and the moving shaft with the adjustment device. The moving shaft of the actuator could also be replaced by one member of a truss structure for vibration suppression and position control purposes. In the proposed actuator the flexure clamps can also be easily replaced to outfit different dynamic characteristics. The complete design of the proposed actuator has been performed using the finite element analysis. The simulation result confirms that the output force of 160 N and incremental displacement in each step of 8.3 $\mu$m can be achieved using the proposed actuator. A prototype of actuator has been fabricated and static tests have been performed to validate the simulation results. {\textcopyright} 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

This 6 degree-of-freedom (DOF) robotic device is piezoelectrically actuated to provide precision motion with joint-level precision of better than 0.03mm, and is fully MRI-compatible allowing simultaneous robotic motion and imaging with no image quality degradation. The MRI compatibility of the robot has been evaluated under 3 Tesla MRI using standard prostate imaging sequences, with an average signal to noise ratio loss of less than 2{\%} during actuator motion. The accuracy of active cannula control was evaluated in benchtop trials using an external optical tracking system with RMS error in tip placement of 1.00mm. Preliminary phantom trials of three active cannula placements in the MRI scanner showed cannula trajectories that agree with our kinematic model, with a RMS tip placement error of 0.61 - 2.24 mm. {\textcopyright} 2012 IEEE.},

abstract = {Study of the plastic deformation in polymeric honeycombs can pave the way for understanding the deformation localization in more complex cellular structures, which have received progressive attention in the past few years. This study compares the strain localization in deforming honeycombs made by two cost-effective 3D-printing technologies. Hexagonal honeycombs and their unit cell models were 3D-printed by both PolyJet™, using a photo-crosslinkable polymer, and fused deposition modeling (FDM) using a thermoplastic material. The state of the art digital image correlation (DIC) technique was employed as the experimental route in order to calculate the strain field during the deformation of manufactured parts. It was found that DIC is an effective tool to study the localization in 3D-printed honeycomb struts. Moreover, in comparison with FDM, PolyJet technology provides more homogeneous strain distributions in struts. In addition, FDM decreases the maximal strains generated on the side layers of the honeycomb struts. Accordingly, the ligament damage under plastic deformation can be postponed and the energy absorption capability of the product can be improved when PolyJet technology is utilized.},

Developments in the modelling, design, manufacturing, testing, and potential applications of auxetic cellular solids, polymers, composites, and sensor/actuator devices are presented. Auxetic cellular solids in the forms of honeycombs and foams are reviewed in terms of their potential in a diverse range of applications, including as core materials in curved sandwich panel composite components, radome applications, directional pass band filters, adaptive and deployable structures, MEMS devices, filters and sieves, seat cushion material, energy absorption components, viscoelastic damping materials, and fastening devices. The review of auxetic polymers includes the fabrication and characterization of microporous polymer solid rods, fibres, and films, as well as progress towards the first synthetic molecular-level auxetic polymer. Potential auxetic polymer applications include self-locking reinforcing fibres in composites, controlled release media, and self-healing films. Auxetic composite laminates and composites containing auxetic constituents are reviewed and enhancements in fracture toughness, and static and low velocity impact performance are presented to demonstrate potential in energy absorber components. Finally, the potential of auxetics as strain amplifiers, piezoelectric devices, and structural health monitoring components is presented. JAERO185 {\textcopyright} IMechE 2007.},

abstract = {Predicting the binding mode of flexible polypeptides to proteins is an important task that falls outside the domain of applicability of most small molecule and protein−protein docking tools. Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-$\alpha$-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 {\AA} for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21{\%} with default Glide SP settings to 58{\%} with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63{\%} success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40{\%} of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

abstract = {We propose a comprehensive approach to characterizing the mechanical properties of structured sheet materials, i.e., planar rod networks whose mechanics and aesthetics are inextricably linked. We establish a connection between the complex mesoscopic deformation behavior of such structures and their macroscopic elastic properties through numerical homogenization. Our approach leverages 3D Kirchhoff rod simulation in order to capture nonlinear effects for both in-plane and bending deformations. We apply our method to different families of structures based on isohedral tilings - a simple yet extensive and aesthetically interesting group of space-filling patterns. We show that these tilings admit a wide range of material properties, and our homogenization approach allows us to create concise and intuitive descriptions of a material's direction-dependent macromechanical behavior that are easy to communicate even to non-experts. We perform this characterization for an extensive set of structures and organize these data in a material browser to enable efficient forward exploration of the aesthetic-mechanical space of structured sheet materials. We also propose an inverse design method to automatically find structure parameters that best approximate a user-specified target behavior.},

abstract = {The current study reports the mechanical properties of 3D printing using multiple composite filaments, infill percentages, and printed structures. Results show that graphene-contained polylactic acid (G-PLA) displays the highest bending strength, of 119.50 MPa, improving by 62.7{\%}, compared with pure PLA. The scanning electron microscopy (SEM) microstructural observations indicate that the high bending strength is caused by the pull-out of graphene. As for the double-filament layer-by-layer alternatively printed specimens, the obtained bending strengths are between the single-filament specimens printed by the two filaments, respectively. Changing infill percentages from 30{\%}, 65{\%}, and to 100{\%} prove that the mechanical properties are greatly enhanced. In the bending tests, with an increase in the infill percentage from 30{\%} to 100{\%}, it is found that all the bending strengths of G-PLA, copper powder-containing polylactic acid (Cu-PLA), and carbon fibers-containing Cf-PLA increase by 63.7{\%}, 130.1{\%}, and 106.6{\%} on account of enlarged cross-section areas sustaining stress. Furthermore, in the compressive tests, shear stress is only found in the hexangular structure, which has a positive effect on the 32.1{\%} increase of the compressive strength compared with that in the rectangular structure. It implies that printed structures significantly influence the fractured modes due to the variation of stress distribution in the designed structures.},

The stepwise cumulative displacement motion can be realized by applying a sawtooth wave signal to the excitation coil. The superimposed flexible hinge effectively improves the force of the system. The equivalent stiffness is calculated by simplifying the flexible hinge into a cantilever beam, and the strength of the flexible hinge is checked, the modal analysis is carried out. The displacement model of inertial actuator is established according to voltage law, magnetoresistance theory, linear piezomagnetic model and dynamic theory. The experimental platform is built and the prototype is designed for test. The experimental and simulation results show that the operating voltage range of the inertial actuator is 3 V–9 V, the maximum operating frequency is 60 Hz, the minimum and maximum single step displacement are 2.41 $\mu$m and 7.49 $\mu$m, and the maximum speed is 449.4 $\mu$m/s. The displacement output is stable, the maximum relative error of the single step displacement is 3.97 {\%}. In the working voltage range, the maximum error between the simulated and experimental values is 4.84 {\%}. And the maximum error between the simulated and experimental values is 2.96 {\%} in the working frequency range. So the design scheme and the displacement model have certain reference significance for the application of large stroke actuator.},

abstract = {Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) can provide high-quality 3-D visualization of prostate and surrounding tissue, thus granting potential to be a superior medical imaging modality for guiding and monitoring prostatic interventions. However, the benefits cannot be readily harnessed for interventional procedures due to difficulties that surround the use of high-field (1.5T or greater) MRI. The inability to use conventional mechatronics and the confined physical space makes it extremely challenging to access the patient. We have designed a robotic assistant system that overcomes these difficulties and promises safe and reliable intraprostatic needle placement inside closed high-field MRI scanners. MRI compatibility of the robot has been evaluated under 3T MRI using standard prostate imaging sequences and average SNR loss is limited to 5{\%}. Needle alignment accuracy of the robot under servo pneumatic control is better than 0.94 mm rms per axis.

We present the development of a 6-degree-of-freedom (DOF) needle placement robot for transperineal prostate interventions. The robot consists of a 3-DOF needle driver module and a 3-DOF Cartesian motion module. The needle driver provides needle cannula translation and rotation (2-DOF) and stylet translation (1-DOF). A custom robot controller consisting of multiple piezoelectric motor drivers provides precision closed-loop control of piezoelectric motors and enables simultaneous robot motion and MR imaging. The developed modular robot control interface software performs image-based registration, kinematics calculation, and exchanges robot commands and coordinates between the navigation software and the robot controller with a new implementation of the open network communication protocol OpenIGTLink. Comprehensive compatibility of the robot is evaluated inside a 3-T MRI scanner using standard imaging sequences and the signal-to-noise ratio loss is limited to 15{\%}. The image deterioration due to the present and motion of robot demonstrates unobservable image interference.

The focus is on producing passive elastomeric components of DEA and the dimensional changes that occur after printing is complete. A four-axis printing system is described, capable of spray depositing multilayer tubular silicone membranes onto an air-permeable mandrel. Mechanical strain was imparted in the membranes by means of inflation. A laser measurement system was constructed to act as a 3D scanner, which measured the shape of the inflated "balloon." The surface shape was reconstructed in software using the parametric modeling tool Grasshopper. Seamless auxetic tessellations were calculated across the entire surface, and then converted to CNC GCode. These toolpaths were then physically extruded over the surface of the balloon, stacked five layers high. When the extruded silicone structure was completely cured, the pneumatic strain was released, allowing the structure to collapse evenly. The compression in the printed structure was balanced by the tension in the stretched membranes, thus producing a minimum energy structure.},

abstract = {Linear actuation is a basic need in robotized manipulation of surgical instruments, that must comply with a challenging environment in terms of safety, compactness and now often compatibility with imaging modalities like CT or MRI. In this paper, we focus on needle manipulation for interventional radiology. We propose a needle driver, i.e. a linear actuator for needle insertion, based on the inchworm principle combined with pneumatic energy. Our first contribution is to propose, model and implement the device using a so-called auxetic structure. Its use increases achievable displacement under pressure and provides sufficient off-axis stiffness to use the actuator without additional guidance. Simplified modeling is introduced for the actuator synthesis. Our second contribution is to implement the actuator with multimaterial additive manufacturing combining rigid and flexible materials to increase compactness. As a third contribution, initial assessment of component sterilization and compatibility with X-ray and MRI imaging modalities is presented.},

abstract = {MRI is an ideal method for non-invasive soft tissue mechanical properties investigation. This requires mechanical excitation of the body's tissues and measurement of the corresponding boundary conditions such as soft tissue deformation inside the MRI environment. However, this is technically difficult since load application and measurement of boundary conditions requires MRI compatible actuators and sensors. This paper describes a novel MRI compatible computer controlled soft tissue indentor and optical Fibre Bragg Grating (FBG) force sensor. The high acquisition rate (100. Hz) force sensor was calibrated for forces up to 15. N and demonstrated a maximum error of 0.043. N. Performance and MRI compatibility of the devices was verified using indentation tests on a silicone gel phantom and the upper arm of a volunteer. The computer controlled indentor provided a highly repeatable tissue deformation. Since the indentor and force sensor are composed of non-ferromagnetic materials, they are MRI compatible and no artefacts or temporal SNR reductions were observed. In a phantom study the mean and standard deviation of the temporal SNR levels without the indentor present were 500.18 and 207.08, respectively. With the indentor present the mean and standard deviation were 501.95 and 200.45, respectively. This computer controlled MRI compatible soft tissue indentation system with an integrated force sensor has a broad range of applications and will be used in the future for the non-invasive analysis of the mechanical properties of skeletal muscle tissue. {\textcopyright} 2012 IPEM.},

This paper presents an original framework for reinforcement of a soft actuator using a generalized NPR element, called a Representative Auxetic Element (RAE), and an experimental validation of the kinematic behavior that it enables. We build a generalized kinematic model that enables the design of RAE-patterned actuators and reveal the distinct auxetic behavior of RAE actuators with comparable model accuracy to the legacy McKibben actuators. A simple, reproducible way of designing and fabricating RAE actuators is described and varied prototypes are shown. This RAE-based design scheme can be used to create actuators with specified kinematics like bending, extension, and radial expansion, which can also vary across the actuator's surface both circumferentially and axially in a tractable, scalable manner.},

abstract = {Linear Incremental Hydraulic Actuators combine one or more short-stroke cylinders, and two or more engaging/disengaging mechanisms into one actuator with long, medium, or even unlimited stroke length. The motion of each single short-stroke actuator concatenated by the engaging/disengaging mechanisms forms the motion of the linear incremental hydraulic actuator. The patterns of how these motions are concatenated form the gaits of a specific linear incremental hydraulic actuator. Linear incremental hydraulic actuators may have more than one gait. In an application, the gaits may be combined to achieve optimal performance at various operating points. The distinguishing characteristic of linear incremental hydraulic actuators is the incremental motion. The term incremental actuator is seen as analogous to the incremental versus absolute position sensor. Incremental actuators realize naturally relative positioning. Incremental motion means also that the behavior does not depend on an absolute position but only on the relative position within a cycle or step. Incremental actuators may realize discrete incremental or continuous incremental motion. Discrete incremental actuators can only approach discrete positions, whereby stepper drives are one prominent example. In contrast, continuous incremental actuators may approach any position. Linear electric motors are one example of continuous incremental actuators. The actuator has no inherent limitation in stroke length, as every step or cycle adds only to the state at the beginning of the step or cycle and does not depend on the absolute position. This led to the alternative working title Hydraulic Infinite Linear Actuator. Linear incremental hydraulic actuator provides long stroke, high force, and linear motion and has the potential to decrease the necessary resource usage, minimize environmental impact, e.g. from potential oil spillage, extend the range of feasible products: longer, stiffer, better, etc. This thesis presents an analysis of the characteristics and properties of linear incremental hydraulic actuators as well as the gaits and possible realizations of some gaits. The gait for continuous, smooth motion with two cylinders is comprehensively studied and a control concept for the tracking problem is proposed. The control concept encapsulates the complexity of the linear incremental hydraulic actuator so that an application does not have to deal with it. One other gait, the ballistic gait, which realizes fast, energy-efficient motion, enabling energy recuperation is studied. },

Centrifugal casting permits simultaneous patterning of multiple sides of a component and allows control of the thickness of the part in an enclosed mold without entrapment of bubbles. Spinning molds filled with PDMS at thousands of revolutions per minute for several minutes causes entrapped bubbles within the PDMS to migrate toward the axis of rotation or dissolve into solution. To cure the parts quickly ({\textless}10 min), active elements heat and cool cavities filled with PDMS after the completion of spinning. Microfluidic channels produced from the process have a low coefficient of variation ({\textless}2{\%} for the height and width of channels measured in 20 parts).

Several structural models are examined. The non-affine kinematics are seen to be essential for the production of negative Poisson's ratios for isotropic materials containing central force linkages of positive stiffness. Non-central forces combined with pre-load can also give rise to a negative Poisson's ratio in isotropic materials. A chiral microstructure with noncentral force interaction or non-affine deformation can also exhibit a negative Poisson's ratio. Toughness and damage resistance in these materials may be affected by the Poisson's ratio itself, as well as by generalized continuum aspects associated with the microstructure. {\textcopyright} 1991 Chapman and Hall Ltd.},

Almost of all these robots use computed tomography (CT) to scan the brain of the patient before and during surgery. Currently, we are developing a needle insertion manipulator for magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)-guided neurosurgery. MRI techniques, including MRI angiography and functional MRI, are attractive for the development of interventional MRI therapies and operations. If a robot were available, these therapies would be minimally invasive, with more accurate guidance than is possible with current CT-guided systems. Actuation of a robot in an MRI environment is difficult because of the presence of strong magnetic fields. Therefore, the robot must be constructed of nonmagnetic materials. The system frame was manufactured using polyethylene terephthalate (PET) and was actuated using ultrasonic motors. Accuracy-evaluation procedures and phantom tests have been performed. The total accuracy of the system was approximately 3.0 mm. No artifacts caused by the manipulator were observed in the images. {\textcopyright} 1995 Informa UK Ltd All rights reserved: reproduction in whole or part not permitted.},

abstract = {When McKibben artificial muscle actuators are used to drive robotic joints, they are typically configured in pairs which act antagonistically to increase joint stiffness. However, this configuration cannot maintain a fixed position without continuous control. The objective of this study is to develop a McKibben artificial muscle which can fix into a rigid shape without the need for continuous control. This is achieved by exploiting the inherent properties of shape-memory polymers (SMPs). SMPs can be deformed above their glass transition temperature (Tg) upon the application of a small load. They can maintain their shape in a rigid form after they have been cooled to below T g. When heated again above Tg, they return to their predefined shape. Exploiting these characteristics, we impregnate the braided mesh shell of a commercial McKibben artificial muscle with SMP resin. When this new actuator is warmed above Tg, it can be used as a conventional McKibben muscle. When the actuator attains its desirable length, it can be cooled to below Tg and the SMP will fix the structure in a rigid, actuated, state. This state is maintained without the need for any air supply or control system. The enhanced versatility of this new actuator is shown through a series of experiments conducted on a prototype SMP McKibben actuator. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Future hydraulic actuation systems can be significantly improved by utilisation of a new type of hydraulic linear actuator technology. By enabling multiple actuating elements, integrated in a compact and lightweight single unit controlled by ordinary directional valves it is possible to achieve a high position accuracy. This is a new way to generate and distribute mechanical linear movement and force by using hydraulic actuators in a cost effective way, in less responsive closed loop systems. This is a variant on the Hydraulic Infinite Linear Actuator, HILA, invention. The technology also represents a new sort of digital hydraulics. The presented technology provides typical hydraulic actuator characteristics with high system pressure and potentially no external oil leakage. It is based on a well-known hydraulic clamping element technology used in a new way, where the piston and the piston rod can quickly be coupled and uncoupled by means of the clamping element in a failsafe way by using well defined incremental steps. HILA in its simplest usage, provides new features to hydraulic cylinders such as providing very long strokes, high rod speed, and small chamber volumes which means high stiffness and low capacitance. The aim of this study is to present a fundamentally new way of using hydraulic actuators. The invention is called the Hydraulic Infinite Linear Actuator with Multiple Rods, HILA MR. The study presents the idea, principles and feasible combinations of the technology. Also applications in the aircraft and robotic field will be presented. },

abstract = {Background: Tactile stimulation used to induce emotional responses is often not well-controlled. Replicating the same tactile stimulations across studies is difficult, compared to replicating visual and auditory modalities, which have standardized stimulus sets. Standardizing a stimulation method by replicating stimuli across studies is necessary to further elucidate emotional responses in neuroscience research using tactile stimulation. The new method: We developed a tactile stimulation device. The device's ultrasonic motor and optical force sensor have the following criteria: (1) controls the physical property of stimuli, pressure, and stroking speed; (2) measures actual touch timing; (3) is safe to use in a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scanner; and (4) produces low noise in electroencephalography (EEG) and MRI. Results: The noise level of the device's drive was sufficiently low. For the EEG experiment, we successfully used signal processing to diminish the commercial power supply noise. For functional MRI (fMRI) scans, we found {\textless}5{\%} signal loss occurred during device rotation. Comparison with existing method(s): We found no previous report about the noise level of a tactile stimulation device used to induce emotional responses during EEG and fMRI recordings. The signal loss rate was comparable with that of other robotic devices used in MRI scanners. Emotional feelings induced by this stimulation method were comparable with those elicited in other sensory modalities. Conclusions: The developed device could be used for cognitive-affective neuroscience research when conducting EEG and fMRI scans. The device should aid in standardizing affective tactile stimulation for research in psychology and cognitive neuroscience.},

Although soft actuators have allowed for a variety of innovative applications, there is a need for design tools that can help to efficiently and systematically design actuators for particular functions. Mathematical modeling of soft actuators is an area that is still in its infancy but has the potential to provide quantitative insights into the response of the actuators. These insights can be used to guide actuator design, thus accelerating the design process. Here, we study fluid-powered fiberreinforced actuators, because these have previously been shown to be capable of producing a wide range of motions. We present a design strategy that takes a kinematic trajectory as its input and uses analytical modeling based on nonlinear elasticity and optimization to identify the optimal design parameters for an actuator that will follow this trajectory upon pressurization. We experimentally verify our modeling approach, and finally we demonstrate how the strategy works, by designing actuators that replicate the motion of the index finger and thumb.},

However, the significant potential of such actuators is currently limited as their design has typically been based on intuition. In this paper, the principle of operation of these actuators is comprehensively analyzed and described through experimentally validated quasi-static analytical and finite-element method models for bending in free space and force generation when in contact with an object. This study provides a set of systematic design rules to help the robotics community create soft actuators by understanding how these vary their outputs as a function of input pressure for a number of geometrical parameters. Additionally, the proposed analytical model is implemented in a controller demonstrating its ability to convert pressure information to bending angle in real time. Such an understanding of soft multimaterial actuators will allow future design concepts to be rapidly iterated and their performance predicted, thus enabling new and innovative applications that produce more complex motions to be explored.},

abstract = {Fiber-reinforced elastomeric enclosures (FREEs) generate sophisticated motions, when pressurized, including axial rotation, extension, and compression, and serve as fundamental building blocks for soft robots in a variety of applications. However, most modeling techniques employed by researchers do not capture the key characteristics of FREEs to enable development of robust design and control schemes. Accurate and computationally efficient models that capture the nonlinearity of fibers and elastomeric components are needed. This paper presents a continuum model that captures the nonlinearities of the fiber and elastomer components as well as nonlinear relationship between applied pressure, deformation, and output forces and torque. One of the key attributes of this model is that it captures the behavior of FREEs in a computationally tractable manner with a minimum burden on experimental parameter determination. Without losing generality of the model, we validate it for a FREE with one fiber family, which is the simplest system exhibiting a combination of elongation and twist when pressurized. Experimental data in multiple kinematic configurations show agreement between our model prediction and the moments that the actuators generate. The model can be used to not only determine operational parameters but also to solve inverse problems, i.e., in design synthesis.},

abstract = {Most devices for single-site or natural orifice transluminal surgery are very application specific and, hence, capable of effectively carrying out specific surgical tasks only. However, most of these instruments are rigid, lack a sufficient number of degrees of freedom (DOFs), and/or are incapable of modifying their mechanical properties based on the tasks to be performed. The current philosophy in commercial instrument design is mainly focused on creating minimally invasive surgical systems using rigid tools equipped with dexterous tips. Only few research efforts are aimed at developing flexible surgical systems, with many DOFs or even continuum kinematics. The authors propose a radical change in surgical instrument design: away from rigid tools toward a new concept of soft and stiffness-controllable instruments. Inspired by biology, we envision creating such soft and stiffness-controllable medical devices using the octopus as a model. The octopus presents all the capabilities requested and can be viewed as a precious source of inspiration. Several soft technologies are suitable for meeting the aforementioned capabilities, and in this article a brief review of the most promising ones is presented. Then we illustrate how specific technologies can be applied in the design of a novel manipulator for flexible surgery by discussing its potential and by presenting feasibility tests of a prototype responding to this new design philosophy. Our aim is to investigate the feasibility of applying these technologies in the field of minimally invasive surgery and at the same time to stimulate the creativeness of others who could take the proposed concepts further to achieve novel solutions and generate specific application scenarios for the devised technologies.},

abstract = {Purpose: This paper presents the results of an experimental investigation with two different rotatory piezomotors in a closed 1.5 Tesla high-field MRI. The focus of the investigation was on testing the functionality of these motors within the MRI and to determining the image interference they caused. Materials and Methods: To obtain a differentiated estimate of the interference the motors were tested in both the passive (turned off, i.e. without current flow) and active (turned on, i.e. with current flow) state during MRI scanning. Three different types of sequences were used for the test: Spin-Echo (SE), Gradient-Echo (GE) and Echo-Planar Imaging (EPI). A plastic container filled with a gadolinium-manganese solution was used for representation of the artefacts. The motors investigated were placed parallel to the container at predetermined distances during the expenment. Results and Conclusions: The results show that the motors investigated suffered no functional limitations in the magnetic field of the MRI but, depending on the type of motor, the measurement distance and the state of the motor, the motors had different effects on the sequence images. A motor in the off-state placed immediately next to the object to be measured mainly causes artefacts because of its material properties. If, on the other hand, the piezomotor is in the on-state images with strong noise result when the motor is immediately next to the object being measured. The images regain their normal quality when the motor is approximately, at a distance of l m from the object being investigated. Driving the motor inside the MRI, therefore, is only to be recommended during the pauses in scanning: this delivers artefact-free images if minimal, motor- specific distances are kept to. With regard to the three different types of sequences it was determined that the SE sequence was the least sensitive and the EPI sequence the most sensitive to disturbance. The GE sequence showed only minimal differences to the SE sequence with regard to signal-to-noise ratios. Since it requires considerably shorter scan-times it can be considered to be the most effective type of sequence under these conditions. {\textcopyright} 2000, Walter de Gruyter.

The robot is intended to enable a new workflow for bone biopsy in pediatrics under MRI imaging. Our long-term objectives are to minimize trauma and eliminate radiation exposure when diagnosing children with bone cancers and bone infections. This article presents our robotic systems, phantom accuracy studies, and workflow analysis. Materials and Methods This section describes several aspects of our work including the envisioned clinical workflow, the MRI-compatible robot, and the experimental setup. The workflow consists of five steps and is intended to enable the entire procedure to be completed in the MRI suite. The MRI-compatible robot is MR Safe, has 3 degrees of freedom, and a remote center of motion mechanism for orienting a needle guide. The accuracy study was done in a Siemens Aera 1.5T scanner with a long bone phantom. Four targeting holes were drilled in the phantom. Results Each target was approached twice at slightly oblique angles using the robot needle guide for a total of eight attempts. A workflow analysis showed the average time for each targeting attempt was 32 minutes, including robot setup time. The average 3D targeting error was 1.39 mm with a standard deviation of 0.40 mm. All of the targets were successfully reached. Conclusion The results showed the ability of the robotic system in assisting the radiologist to precisely target a bone phantom in the MRI environment. The robot system has several potential advantages for clinical application, including the ability to work at the MRI isocenter and serve as a steady and precise guide.},

abstract = {Compliant structures allow robots to overcome environmental challenges by deforming and conforming their bodies. In this paper, we investigate auxetic structures as a means of achieving this compliance for soft robots. Taking a tiling based approach, we fabricate 3D printed cylindrical auxetic structures to create tiled auxetic cylinders (TACs). We characterise the relative stiffness of the structures and show that variation in behaviour can be achieved by modifying the geometry within the same tiling family. In addition, we analysed the equivalent Poisson's ratio and found the range between the investigated designs to span from -0.33 to -2. Furthermore, we demonstrate a conceptual application in the design of a soft robot using the auxetic cylinders. We show that these structures can reactively change in shape, thereby reducing the complexity of control, with potential applications in confined spaces such as the human body, or for exploration through unpredictable terrain.},

abstract = {Auxetic materials (or metamaterials) are those with a negative Poisson ratio (NPR) and display the unexpected property of lateral expansion when stretched, as well as an equal and opposing densification when compressed. Such geometries are being progressively employed in the development of novel products, especially in the fields of intelligent expandable actuators, shape morphing structures and minimally invasive implantable devices. Although several auxetic and potentially auxetic geometries have been summarized in previous reviews and research, precise information regarding relevant properties for design tasks is not always provided. In this study we present a comparative study of two-dimensional and three-dimensional auxetic geometries carried out by means of computer-aided design and engineering tools (from now on CADCAE). The first part of the study is focused on the development of a CAD library of auxetics. Once the library is developed we simulate the behavior of the different auxetic geometries and elaborate a systematic comparison, considering relevant properties of these geometries, such as Poisson ratio(s), maximum volume or area reductions attainable and equivalent Youngs modulus, hoping it may provide useful information for future designs of devices based on these interesting structures. {\textcopyright} 2012 IOP Publishing Ltd.},
